# CAN-dropout-error-counter

Basically just run the counter.m file and give it a directory with MF4s. The other two .m files are functions that are required for the counter script to work. The output log is located in the new folder as dropouts_and_errors.txt

This will not overwrite the original MF4 files. It makes a new directory and copies the files over, then makes modifications to the copied files.
